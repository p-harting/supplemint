#### Key Models and Relationships

1. **Bag Model**:  
   The `Bag` model represents the shopping cart functionality. It tracks the products that a user has added to their cart before proceeding to checkout. Each `Bag` is associated with a `UserProfile`, allowing for the tracking of individual user carts.

2. **Blog Model**:  
   The `Blog` model stores blog posts that provide useful information to users, such as product updates, promotions, or general lifestyle content. The model includes fields like title, content, and metadata for SEO purposes. Each blog post can be linked to a specific user (author) and can be marked as published or unpublished.

3. **Checkout Model**:  
   The `Checkout` model handles the entire checkout process, including managing the user’s order details, payment information, and shipping address. It is connected to the `Order` model and ensures that all necessary data is captured for order fulfillment.

4. **Contact Model**:  
   The `Contact` model stores user inquiries from the contact form. Users can submit questions or concerns, which are stored in this model. It includes fields like name, email, subject, and message, allowing the team to respond accordingly.

5. **Core Model**:  
   The `Core` model is a utility app that handles form validation and acts as a base for all other models. It provides shared functionality across the application, ensuring consistency in data handling and validation.

6. **Home Model**:  
   The `Home` model is responsible for managing the content displayed on the homepage of the website. It includes promotional banners, featured products, and general content that serves as an entry point for users to explore the site.

7. **Products Model**:  
   The `Products` model represents individual products in the store, with detailed information such as name, description, price, and stock. It also contains references to the `Category` and `SubCategory` models, helping to organize products in a way that makes them easy to browse. This model is linked to `ProductSize` for size-specific products and `Sale` for discount offers.

8. **Profiles Model**:  
   The `Profiles` model extends the `User` model to include detailed personal information, such as shipping address, phone number, and loyalty points. This model ensures that each user’s profile is stored and accessible for order processing and personalization.

9. **Referrals Model**:  
   The `Referrals` model enables a referral system where users can share unique referral codes. It tracks the number of successful referrals and the associated earnings. This model is linked to both the `User` and `ReferralTransaction` models, tracking the referral activity and rewards.

10. **Reviews Model**:  
    The `Reviews` model allows users to leave feedback on products they’ve purchased. It stores ratings, text reviews, and approval statuses. Reviews are linked to both the `Product` and `User` models, providing insights into product performance and customer satisfaction.

### Data Handling and Privacy

1. **Django ORM Integration**:  
   The app integrates with PostgreSQL using Django’s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. This facilitates smooth database operations and helps maintain a clean and manageable codebase.

2. **Data Privacy**:  
   Sensitive data, such as user passwords, are hashed before storage using Django’s built-in hashing mechanisms. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain secure.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:  
   The app updates cart information and order statuses in real-time. This ensures users receive immediate feedback on their purchases and cart modifications.

4. **Security Measures**:  
   Django’s built-in security features, including SQL injection prevention, cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, are employed to enhance the security of data interactions within the app.  
   - **CSRF Token**: The `{% csrf_token %}` template tag is used to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks, ensuring that forms submitted on the website are secure.
   - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: A strict content security policy is implemented to prevent XSS and data injection attacks. The policy restricts the sources of content that can be loaded by the browser, protecting the app from malicious third-party scripts.

5. **Static and Media Files Management**:  
   AWS S3 is used to handle the storage and serving of static and media files. This ensures that media files such as product images are stored securely and delivered quickly to users. The use of AWS also helps with scalability and performance.
   - **Static Files**: Managed and served via AWS S3, ensuring fast loading times and reliability.
   - **Media Files**: Product images, blog post images, and user-uploaded files are stored in AWS S3.

6. **User Account Security**:  
   - **Email Confirmation**: Accounts require email confirmation during registration. A verification email is sent to the user with a link to confirm their email address before the account is activated.
   - **Password Reset**: Users can reset their passwords via email. A password reset link is sent to the user’s email address, allowing them to securely change their password.

### API Integration

The application integrates with several external APIs to enhance functionality and provide a seamless user experience:

1. **Stripe API**  
   **Payment Processing**: The Stripe API is used to handle secure payment processing during the checkout process. It ensures that all transactions are securely handled, providing customers with a variety of payment options. The integration includes features such as:
   - Secure handling of payment information.
   - Real-time transaction status updates.
   - Support for various payment methods, including credit/debit cards.

2. **Google Gmail API**  
   **Email Notifications**: The Google Gmail API is used to send automated email notifications to users. This includes:
   - **Order Confirmation Emails**: Sent to users after a successful purchase, providing them with details of their order.
   - **Newsletter Subscription**: Automated welcome emails and regular newsletters are sent to subscribers using this API.
   - **Contact Form Responses**: When users submit queries through the Contact Us page, responses are handled via the Gmail API.

## Agile Methodology

### Overview

For the development of this project, I adopted the **Agile Methodology**, focusing on short sprints and frequent iterations to ensure continuous progress. Given that I worked solo on the project, I kept the sprints relatively short (typically lasting about 2 days) to maintain a high level of focus and efficiency. The Agile approach allowed me to adjust the project direction as needed based on frequent feedback and changing priorities.

### Sprint Planning and Execution

Since I was managing the entire project by myself, I used **GitHub Projects** to organize and plan my sprints. The tasks were tracked using **GitHub Issues**, which were linked directly to specific milestones. Each sprint consisted of a focused set of tasks, which I aimed to complete in two-day intervals. After each sprint, I reviewed the progress and adjusted the plan based on what was achieved, feedback from testers, and any new priorities that emerged.

### Feedback and Iteration

Throughout the development process, I sought feedback from friends and fellow students. This feedback was invaluable in refining the user interface, improving the functionality, and ensuring that the project met user expectations. By integrating this feedback into the project, I was able to make informed adjustments and continuously improve the product in an iterative manner.

### Key Practices

- **Short Sprints**: Each sprint lasted about two days, enabling rapid development cycles and ensuring that I could quickly implement and test features.
- **Frequent Feedback**: I regularly shared progress with friends and other students to gather diverse perspectives and identify areas for improvement.
- **Continuous Adjustments**: Based on feedback and testing, I adapted the features and flow of the application to enhance usability and meet the project goals.
- **GitHub Projects and Issues**: GitHub Projects helped organize the tasks, while GitHub Issues allowed me to track each task and its progress efficiently. This structure provided clarity and visibility throughout the development process.

### Benefits of Agile Methodology in Solo Development

- **Flexibility**: The short sprint cycles provided the flexibility to quickly pivot and make adjustments when necessary, ensuring the project was always moving forward.
- **Rapid Prototyping and Testing**: The iterative approach allowed me to build and test features incrementally, leading to quicker identification and resolution of issues.
- **Efficient Task Management**: By breaking the project down into smaller, manageable tasks and using GitHub to track progress, I could stay organized and maintain focus on completing specific goals.
- **Continuous Improvement**: With feedback from peers and constant iteration, I was able to improve the overall user experience and functionality of the application.

## UI/UX Design Documentation

### Overview

This section outlines the **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design process for the project. The design was created with a focus on delivering an intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: 
   The design prioritizes simplicity, ensuring users can easily navigate through the website without feeling overwhelmed. Clear calls-to-action (CTAs) and a streamlined layout guide users toward completing key actions, such as making a purchase or leaving a review.

2. **Consistency**: 
   Consistent design elements were used across all pages, including typography, buttons, and icons, to ensure a unified experience. This helps users become familiar with the interface and makes navigation intuitive.

3. **Mobile-First Design**: 
   The website was built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that it is fully responsive and functional on mobile devices before scaling up to larger screen sizes.

4. **User-Centered Design**: 
   The design process involved gathering feedback from users and peers to ensure the platform was easy to use and met user needs. The goal was to create an experience that was not only functional but also enjoyable for the user.

5. **Accessibility**: 
   The platform was designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it adheres to web accessibility standards, including proper color contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader compatibility.

### Color Palette

The primary color for the platform is **Mint Green (#ADEBB3)**, which is reflected in the name "Supplemint." This color was chosen to convey a fresh, clean, and calming aesthetic, aligning with the theme of health and wellness.

Other colors used in the design include:

- **Black (#000000)**: Used for text and key elements to provide contrast and readability.
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Used for background areas to create a clean, minimalistic look.
- **Red (#FF4444)**: Used for highlighting important actions, such as errors or notifications.
- **Gray (#333333)**: Used for primary text and background elements to create a balanced design.
- **Gray (#444444)**: Used for secondary text and subtle elements to add depth and structure.

![Color Palette](media/documentation/wireframes/color-palette.png)

### Visual Design

1. **Homepage (Index Page)**:
   - The homepage features a clean layout with a prominent call-to-action (CTA) directing users to browse products.
   - Key sections include featured products, promotions, and a search bar.
   - The design focuses on clear navigation, with categories and popular products easily accessible.

2. **Product Details Page**:
   - The product details page includes an image carousel for product visuals, a detailed description, pricing, and available sizes.
   - The "Add to Cart" button is prominently displayed, making it easy for users to add products to their cart.
   - Reviews and ratings are also featured on the page, encouraging user engagement.

3. **Category Page**:
   - The category page presents products in a grid layout, making it easy for users to browse through items.
   - Filters and sorting options allow users to refine their search by price, rating, or other criteria.
   - The design ensures that users can easily navigate between different categories and subcategories.

### Future Improvements

1. **Use of Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap**:
   In future iterations of this project, I plan to integrate **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for faster and more efficient front-end development. Writing custom CSS for every element was time-consuming and challenging to maintain. Using a utility-first framework like Tailwind will allow for quicker styling and more consistent design patterns.

2. **Enhanced Accessibility**:
   While the platform adheres to basic accessibility standards, there are opportunities to improve the user experience for people with disabilities. Future updates will focus on enhancing keyboard navigation, adding ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels, and improving screen reader support.

3. **Optimized Mobile Design**:
   Although the mobile-first approach was implemented, there is still room for improvement in certain mobile interactions, such as product image zoom and cart management. These will be optimized in future versions to provide a smoother mobile experience.

4. **Design System**:
   Moving forward, I plan to create a **design system** to streamline the development process and ensure consistency across the platform. This system will include reusable components, styles, and design patterns that can be easily implemented and maintained.

### Summary

## Deployment

The **Supplemint** Django application was deployed on **Heroku**, leveraging its seamless integration with GitHub for efficient deployment. Below is a detailed overview of the deployment process, including the necessary configurations and adjustments made to ensure a smooth and secure deployment.

---

### 1. **Heroku App Creation**
- A new Heroku app was created by logging into the Heroku dashboard and selecting **"New" > "Create new app"**.
- A unique app name was chosen, and the appropriate region was selected to optimize performance.

---

### 2. **GitHub Integration**
- In the **"Deploy"** tab of the Heroku app, GitHub was selected as the deployment method.
- The repository containing the Django application was connected to Heroku, enabling automatic deployments upon pushing changes to the main branch.

---

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- In the **"Settings"** tab, the **"Reveal Config Vars"** option was used to add the necessary environment variables. These included:
  - **SECRET_KEY**: The Django secret key for securing the application.
  - **DATABASE_URL**: The URL for the PostgreSQL database provided by Heroku.
  - **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Credentials for integrating Amazon AWS S3 buckets for static and media file storage.
  - **EMAIL_HOST_PASS** and **EMAIL_HOST_USER**: Credentials for sending transactional emails via the configured email service.
  - **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** and **STRIPE_WH_SECRET**: Keys for enabling secure payment processing through Stripe.

---

### 4. **Database Configuration**
- The **DATABASE_URL** environment variable was used to configure the PostgreSQL database in the Django settings. This ensured a reliable and scalable database connection for the application.

---

### 5. **Amazon AWS S3 Integration**
- Instead of using Cloudinary, **Amazon AWS S3** was utilized for storing static and media files. The following steps were taken:
  - An S3 bucket was created, and the necessary permissions were configured.
  - The **django-storages** library was installed and configured in the Django settings to enable S3 integration.
  - The **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** environment variables were added to Heroku to authenticate the S3 connection.

---

### 6. **Buildpack Configuration**
- In the **"Settings"** tab, the **"Buildpacks"** section was accessed, and the **heroku/python** buildpack was added. This ensured that Heroku recognized the application as a Python-based project.

---

### 7. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- To enhance security, a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** was implemented in the Django settings. This included:
  - Allowing trusted sources for scripts, styles, and images.
  - Restricting unsafe inline scripts and styles to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - Configuring the CSP to work seamlessly with AWS S3 for serving static and media files.

---

### 8. **Manual Deployment**
- In the **"Deploy"** tab, the **main branch** was selected for deployment, and the **"Deploy Branch"** button was clicked to initiate the deployment process.
- Once the deployment was complete, the application was verified by clicking **"View"** to ensure it was functioning as expected.

---

### 9. **Post-Deployment Verification**
- After deployment, the application was thoroughly tested to ensure all features, including product browsing, cart management, and Stripe payments, were working correctly.
- Error logs and performance metrics were monitored using Heroku's built-in tools to identify and resolve any issues promptly.
